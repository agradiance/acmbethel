    THE CALLING
Service begins by calling – a call to serve – however, the calling of God is not of one’s
perfection! For no one takes this honour unto himself, but he must be called by God Heb.5:4. Every
calling is to set one apart from the crowd, and our primary separation is from the world and place of
comfort. Hence, God’s calling comes with responsibilities and demands: some of our personalities,
priorities, ambitions, attitudes and characters might be crucified in order to stay committed to His calling
– purity begins by commitment! However, our responses to these demands will determine what God
will achieve through us. Other uniqueness [among us] depends on the peculiarity of God’s dealings
with us.
</div>

<div id="col2"> 
    THE MAKING
It is not enough to be called, there is a place of making – unless you are not made, you cannot
become! How far you will go in life is determine by two things: what you are made of, and what you
are made for. The former could place limitations and constraints to the latter. Hence, one must be
watchful and careful on what constitute and make up his life. The word of God is the fundamental and
essential ingredient for God’s making: it can form, transform and reform lives purposefully. Although,
we can learn from experience, literature, philosophy and others, God's making process cannot be
substituted and it does not blend with our comforts. Sometimes it could go extreme with discipline,
reprove and chastening and unless we gain the heart of humility and total submission we cannot endure
His furnace (Heb. 12:5-11; James 4: 6-10; 1Pet. 5:5-6; Rev. 3:19). I'm not so sure if every man will
survive God’s chamber… but I'm certain that no vessel comes out of his furnace unrefined and
undefined. Moreover, many would choose to skip this phase and run into service, some who tasted it
would either quit and walk away or escape serving prematurely – of course with unfulfilled life. But
those who became great and mighty warriors in God's hand learnt to endure the heat from His crucible.
Just like the SON (Standard Organization of Nigeria) these vessels have the hallmark of God called
SOG –Spirit of God – as an evidence and prove that their lives have been worked upon, hence they
can offer service from a pure heart that is acceptable to God.
Be made!

<div id="col3">
    THE SERVICE.
Service is a form of worship unto God; and this must be done in Spirit and in Truth, for God is
Spirit (Jn. 4:24). However, consistent worship is the one devoid of circumstances, influences,
incentives, selfish ambition and vain glory. It is a product from a pure conscience and could only be
achieved by being likeminded, having the same love, being one in Spirit and purpose (Phi. 2:1-4). So,
here is a question to your heart, those things you are doing for God, are they to build your
portfolios? It is not the amount of works that you did, but the ones that are desirable and pleasant to
God.
